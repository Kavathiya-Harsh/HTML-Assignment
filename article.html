    <h1>History of Computers and the Internet</h1>

    <hr>

    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The development of <strong>computers</strong> can be traced back to early mechanical devices like the
        <i>abacus</i>, but the first real computer is considered to be the <u>Analytical Engine</u>, designed by
        <cite>Charles Babbage</cite>. This machine was never built during his lifetime, but its concepts laid the
        groundwork for modern computing. <em>Ada Lovelace</em>, often credited as the first programmer, wrote an
        algorithm intended for this machine. The early 20th century saw inventions like the <abbr
            title="Zuse Computer">Z3</abbr> by Konrad Zuse, which was the first programmable digital computer. These
        early machines were massive, occupying entire rooms, and used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark> for processing.
        <small>Compared to today's microprocessors</small>, their power was incredibly limited. Still, they represented
        a <b>bold leap</b> into the future. Mathematically, many processes depended on equations such as <var>E</var> =
        <var>mc</var><sup>2</sup>, reflecting the era's deep reliance on scientific innovation.

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The evolution of computing is often categorized into <strong>five generations</strong>. The <b>first
            generation</b> (1940s-1950s) used vacuum tubes and had very limited capabilities. The <i>second
            generation</i> introduced <abbr title="Transistor-based computers">transistors</abbr>, improving speed and
        efficiency. During the <u>third generation</u>, integrated circuits revolutionized the design, making machines
        more compact. The <strong>fourth generation</strong> brought us microprocessors, and it's still in widespread
        use today. Some say we've entered the <em>fifth generation</em>, focusing on <mark>artificial
            intelligence</mark> and <abbr title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</abbr>. One can't forget the
        incredible advances in <code>hardware</code> and <code>software</code> that accompanied each phase. Notably,
        programming languages evolved from machine code to <kbd>Python</kbd>, <kbd>JavaScript</kbd>, and more. We now
        use highly interactive environments where <samp>output = model.predict(input)</samp> is a standard operation in
        data science.

    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>Internet</strong> as we know it began as a military project called <abbr
            title="Advanced Research Projects Agency Network">ARPANET</abbr> in the late 1960s. Initially, it was a
        network of only four computers. Over time, it grew into a global phenomenon. By the 1990s, with the invention of
        the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> by <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>, the Internet transitioned from a
        research tool to a household utility. One famous quote often attributed to Berners-Lee encapsulates the
        philosophy of the Internet:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <q>The Web does not just connect machines, it connects people.</q>
        <br>— <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        With the introduction of <code>HTML</code> and browsers like <i>Mosaic</i>, users could now access information
        visually. This gave rise to web design, interactivity, and e-commerce. Technologies such as <code>CSS</code> and
        <code>JavaScript</code> transformed static pages into dynamic experiences. Mathematically, the data transmitted
        could be represented as <var>P</var><sub>n</sub> = <var>P</var><sub>0</sub> * (1 + <var>r</var>)<sup>n</sup>,
        showcasing the exponential growth in users and data.
    </p>

    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
    <p>
        In the <u>modern computing era</u>, computers are not just tools; they are integrated into daily life. From
        smartphones and smartwatches to cloud computing and <em>edge AI</em>, the scope has dramatically expanded.
        <mark>Cloud platforms</mark> like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud allow for scalable computing beyond what was ever
        imagined. Open-source software has made development collaborative and accessible. Code-sharing platforms such as
        <cite>GitHub</cite> changed the development landscape. Additionally, the rise of cryptocurrencies and blockchain
        technology introduced a new form of computing based on <code>decentralized</code> protocols. Meanwhile,
        researchers rely on formulas like <var>A</var> = <var>π</var><var>r</var><sup>2</sup> for simulations in physics
        and engineering. With the proliferation of IoT, even household items have embedded CPUs. <del>Typewriters</del>
        are a relic; today's equivalent is an AI-powered assistant.

    <h2>Sample Code Snippet</h2>
    <pre><code>
// Simple JavaScript program to greet user
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

let user = "World";
console.log(greet(user)); // Output: Hello, World!
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        The above snippet demonstrates basic use of functions and string concatenation. In modern development, such code
        would be tested using frameworks and run in environments like <kbd>Node.js</kbd>. When something fails, you'd
        typically see output like <samp>ReferenceError: x is not defined</samp>.
    </p>

        <ins>This article has been revised</ins> to reflect recent trends and historical accuracy. From the
        <strong>humble beginnings</strong> of computing to today's <em>intelligent systems</em>, the journey of
        computers and the Internet is nothing short of <mark>extraordinary</mark>.
