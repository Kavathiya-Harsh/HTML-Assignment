    <h1>Delhi</h1>

    <p>
        Delhi, the capital of India, is a vibrant city that blends ancient history with modern culture. <br>
        It's home to stunning monuments like the <b>Red Fort</b>, <i>Qutub Minar</i>, and <u>India Gate</u>. Each corner
        of the city tells a story of dynasties, empires, and revolutions.
    </p>

    <p>
        The city is known for its bustling markets, delicious street food, and spiritual centers. <br>
        Whether you're shopping in <mark>Chandni Chowk</mark> or visiting the peaceful Lotus Temple, Delhi offers a
        unique mix of chaos and calm.
    </p>

    <p>
        I loved exploring the rich cultural diversity in Delhi. <br>
        From traditional festivals to contemporary art galleries, the city is a hub of creativity, tradition, and
        progress. <br>
        The energy of Delhi is truly unmatched.
