    <h1>Mumbai</h1>

    <p>
        Mumbai, also known as <i>“The City of Dreams”</i>, is India's financial and entertainment capital. <br>
        It's a city that never sleeps — fast-paced, energetic, and full of life. From skyscrapers to slums, Mumbai is a city of contrasts.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the must-visit places in Mumbai is the <b>Gateway of India</b>, a historic monument by the sea. <br>
        You can also take a boat ride to the ancient <u>Elephanta Caves</u> or relax at the famous <mark>Marine Drive</mark>, especially at sunset.
    </p>

    <p>
        What I love most about Mumbai is its spirit — no matter the challenges, the people are full of hope and determination. <br>
        The local street food, especially <b>vada pav</b> and <i>pani puri</i>, is simply delicious. Mumbai truly captures the heart of anyone who visits.
